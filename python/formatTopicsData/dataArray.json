It was an act of stealth\n    And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice\n    Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;\n    Leaving behind her still, on either side,\n    Small circles glittering idly in the moon,\n    Until they melted all into one track\n    Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,\n    Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point\n    With an unswerving line, I fixed my view\n    Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,\n    The horizon's utmost boundary; far above\n    Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\n    She was an elfin pinnace; lustily\n    I dipped my oars into the silent lake,\n    And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat\n    Went heaving through the water like a swan;\n    When, from behind that craggy steep till then\n    The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,\n    As if with voluntary power instinct,\n    Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,\n    And growing still in stature the grim shape\n    Towered up between me and the stars, and still,\n    For so it seemed, with purpose of its own\n    And measured motion like a living thing,\n    Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,\n    And through the silent water stole my way\n    Back to the covert of the willow tree;\n    There in her mooring-place I left my bark, -\n    And through the meadows homeward went, in grave\n    And serious mood; but after I had seen\n    That spectacle, for many days, my brain\n    Worked with a dim and undetermined sense\n    Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts\n    There hung a darkness, call it solitude\n    Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes\n    Remained, no pleasant images of trees,\n    Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\n    But huge and mighty forms, that do not live\n    Like living men, moved slowly through the mind\n    By day, and were a trouble to my dreams."

I said\n    \"Fr\u00e0 Pandolf\" by design, for never read\n    Strangers like you that pictured countenance,\n    The depth and passion of its earnest glance,\n    But to myself they turned (since none puts by\n    The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)\n    And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,\n    How such a glance came there; so, not the first\n    Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not\n    Her husband's presence only, called that spot\n    Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps\n    Fr\u00e0 Pandolf chanced to say, \"Her mantle laps\n    Over my lady's wrist too much,\" or \"Paint\n    Must never hope to reproduce the faint\n    Half-flush that dies along her throat\": such stuff\n    Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough\n    For calling up that spot of joy. She had\n    A heart\u2014how shall I say?\u2014too soon made glad,\n    Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er\n    She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.\n    Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,\n    The dropping of the daylight in the West,\n    The bough of cherries some officious fool\n    Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule\n    She rode with round the terrace\u2014all and each\n    Would draw from her alike the approving speech,\n    Or blush, at least. She thanked men,\u2014good! but thanked\n    Somehow\u2014I know not how\u2014as if she ranked\n    My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name\n    With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame\n    This sort of trifling? Even had you skill\n    In speech\u2014which I have not\u2014to make your will\n    Quite clear to such an one, and say, \"Just this\n    Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,\n    Or there exceed the mark\"\u2014and if she let\n    Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set\n    Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,\n    \u2014E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose\n    Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,\n    Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without\n    Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;\n    Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands\n    As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet\n    The company below, then. I repeat,\n    The Count your master's known munificence\n    Is ample warrant that no just pretence\n    Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;\n    Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed\n    At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go\n    Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,\n    Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,\n    Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!"
